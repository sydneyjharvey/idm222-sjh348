                <p>Hello! My name is Sydney Harvey. I am currently a student at Drexel University studying towards an undergrad degree in UX and UI design. Beyond that I am a creative, an aspiring “jack-of-all-trades”, and death to any plant I get my hands on. Most importantly though, I like to think I’m a chill and kind person who loves making people laugh.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in Central Jersey, land of road-side farmers markets, chrome-siding diners, and QuickChek convenience stores (These all relate to food, they don’t call it The Garden State for nothing!) Growing up, I’ve always loved learning. I would spend my nights pouring over children's books about space, science, culture, and much more. That want to learn has been with me all my life, and I’ve constantly found myself new hobbies to intently research and tackle. Illustration, cartooning, costume design, practical effects, coding, and the trumpet. I wouldn’t call myself an expert in most of these, like I said I consider myself a “jack-of-all-trades” type. Dipping your toes into as many different skills as you can widens your perspective. So I try to be open-minded and eager to learn!</p>
                <p>As of now, I am deep in the thick of my studies at Drexel. I’ve learned a great deal! On how to properly utilize various web code languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. On design sensibilities and how to prioritize them against aesthetics, usability, practicality. On late night work sessions and caffeine as well, but that’s neither here nor there. I’m aiming to specialize in UX research and development upon graduating. But for now, I’m enjoying learning and growing.</p>
